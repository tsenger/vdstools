      VdsTools is a software library for decoding, verifying,  encoding, and
      signing Visible Digital Seals (VDS).
    longDescription: >
      VdsTools is a software library for decoding, verifying, encoding, and
      signing Visible Digital Seals (VDS). These visual digital seals are found
      on official government documents such as:


      - Residence permits 

      - Arrival attestation 

      - Address stickers on ID cards and passports 

      - Emergency travel documents 

      - Visas 

      - ... and upcoming profiles 


      The library processes the content of barcodes and makes the information
      available via a generic API. The scanning and reading of the seal barcode
      itself must be handled by a separate component (e.g., a barcode scanner
      library). The library implements the following specifications:


      - BSI TR-03137-1 

      - ICAO Doc 9303-13: Visible Digital Seals 

      - ICAO TR "VDS for Non-Electronic Documents" 

      - ICAO Datastructure for Barcode 


      Releases are available on Maven Central for easy integration into own
      projects.
